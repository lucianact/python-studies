# Graphs:
# are like tree, excep they contain loops (cycles)
# relantionships can be direct or undirect 
# are often used to model relationship between things
# graphs can be connected or disconnected 
# trees are directed, acyclic graphs
# all trees are graphs, but not all graphs are trees
# trees have a hierarchy, graphs do not 

# Terminology:
# nodes or vertex -> basic unit
# edge or arc -> connecst two nodes
# adjacent -> two nodes are "adjacent" if they share an edge
# adjacency list -> for a given node, a list of every node directly connect to
# weight (optional) -> each edge can have a weight (price, distance, etc)

# Example:
# Airline route map
# -> each node is an airport
# -> each edge is a flight
# -> the weight of each edge is the price
# what's the cheapest way to go from atlanta to oakland? 

# Carpooling
# -> each node is a rider
# -> edges represents possible carpooling matches
# -> only two people can carpool together at a time
# -> how can we match the maximum number os pairs of riders?
